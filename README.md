Navigation Bar:

The navigation bar includes a brand logo, notification, inbox, and video icons.
A search box allows users to search for content.
A user profile icon with a settings menu dropdown is also included.

Settings Menu:
The settings menu appears on clicking the profile icon.
It includes options for setting themes, viewing the user profile, giving feedback, and links for settings, privacy, help, and logout.

Left Sidebar:
Contains important links like "Latest News," "Friends," "Groups," and "Marketplace."
Also includes a shortcut section for quick access to pages/groups such as "Web Developers" and "Full Stack Development."

Main Content:
Story Gallery: Displays a gallery of user stories with options for the current user to post their own story.
Post Creation: A write-post container allows the user to create new posts. It includes input fields for text, options for adding live videos, photos, or activities.
Post Feed: Multiple post containers are present, displaying user posts with content, timestamps, images, and interaction options like "Like," "Comment," and "Share." Each post includes a user profile, a dropdown menu for additional options, and a text section with hashtags.

Right Sidebar:
Displays "Events" and possibly a "See All" link, likely for upcoming events or user interests.
Could potentially be expanded to include ads, friend suggestions, or trending topics.

Load More Button:
Positioned at the end of the main content area to load more posts dynamically as the user scrolls.
Key Technologies and Enhancements

Font Awesome: Icons for various interactive elements like "settings," "comment," and "like" buttons.

Styling and Layouts: Though the CSS isn't included, the layout suggests a responsive design.

JavaScript (Potential Enhancements):
You could add interactivity with JavaScript, such as expanding/collapsing menus, dynamically loading posts, and toggling dark mode (the dark mode button is present but not yet functional).
An onclick function for settings could be used to show or hide the settings menu on demand.
Additional Functionalities to Implement

Dark Mode: Thereâ€™s a button for dark mode, so adding CSS styles and JavaScript to toggle the theme would improve user experience.
Dynamic Content Loading: Using JavaScript to load more posts when the "Load More" button is clicked.
User Authentication: Implementing a login system would be a logical next step, possibly with options to keep the user logged in.
Backend Integration: Connect with a backend to pull user posts, notifications, messages, and user settings.
